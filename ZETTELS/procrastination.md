### Procrastination
> What is procrastination? Why do you get this feeling of not willing to undertake the task and try to avoid it at all cost? What part of you is responsible for giving this impulse? What scares you off in that undertaking and makes you postpone it for a long time? There are reasons to it, and they should be closer to the body than to the mind.

> Think about your needs and wants. Are they satisfied?

> Is thinking about the task overwhelms you? Or do you get tired thinking ahead of doing? Do you see many uncertainties in your task? Maybe you feel [anxious](anxiety.md) about it?

Suggestions to deal with procrastination:

- Try to [ritualize](ritualize_routine.md) or gamify your routine.

- Satisfy your physical and mental needs.

- Plan your work on paper (unload thoughts onto medium). Do not try to plan too much ahead, and don't worry if you are unable to follow the plan fully. What matters is to have plan in the first place.

- Try to reduce the number of uncertainties and unknowns. Practice [discipline](discipline.md).

- Try to monitor your thinking, prevent yourself from getting into dangerous loops which may lead to anxiety. Regular [exercises](exercises.md) may help with it.

- Stress-boost yourself (use with caution). For instance, think about deadlines and brace yourself for a "sprint".

- Try to implement "Pomodoro technique".
