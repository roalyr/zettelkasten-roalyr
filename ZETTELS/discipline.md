### Discipline

> Discipline is an effort transformed into potential to act upon your [motivation](motivation.md).

> The key idea of cultivating discipline lies in increasing the [determinism](determinism.md), which reduces mental fatigue, [anxiety](anxiety.md) and gets things done. Basically, you know what to do next (assuming you have written an approximate plan for a day).

> Discipline is NOT a punishment. It is a small price in effort that you pay to get things done. This price is LESS than the price which is required to deal with anxiety and frustration due to things not being done.

> Treat discipline as craft, as exercise.

> The key principle is to act upon planned task without delay and without internal arguments. When you argue with yourself to find a reason to not to act, you spend more effort than it takes to make a will-powered decision to act.

Benefits of discipline:
- Tasks are being done. Progress.
- Satisfaction due to completing tasks.
- Reduced level of uncertainties and anxiety.
- Pride in being consistent in your actions.
